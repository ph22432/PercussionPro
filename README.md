# PercussionPro

An Android app facilitating practise of Afro-Cuban percussion instruments through real-time feedback. This app allows you to:
 - Play along to the provided patterns from a selection of Cuban music styles to get live information on your rhythmic accuracy
 - Listen to example recordings of patterns with sheet music to gain a better understanding of them
 - View the spectrogram generated by your playing to see tonal information

The app functions through a low-latency C++ backend connected to a UI written in Jetpack Compose. Low latency audio is achieved through Google's Oboe library.
